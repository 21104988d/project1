## ‚ö° One-Click Complete Setup (5 minutes)

### üîß Prerequisites Auto-Installation

**Starting with only VS Code?** No problem! Our setup handles everything:

#### **Option 1: Automated Everything (Recommended)**

1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Press `Ctrl+`` (backtick) to open terminal**
3. **Copy and paste this ONE command:**

```bash
# This installs Git, Node.js, clones repo, and starts the app
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/21104988d/project1/main/scripts/complete-setup.sh | bash
```

> **Note**: If the automated setup fails, the script will provide detailed manual setup instructions. This is usually due to repository structure issues but can be easily resolved.

> **Recommended**: For the best experience, use **GitHub Codespaces**:
>
> 1. Go to: https://github.com/21104988d/project1
> 2. Click "Code" ‚Üí "Codespaces" ‚Üí "Create codespace"
> 3. Wait for the environment to load
> 4. Run: `cd the-project && npm install && npm run dev`

#### **Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step**

**Step 1: Install Git**

```bash
# Windows (in VS Code terminal)
winget install Git.Git
# OR download from: https://git-scm.com/downloads

# macOS
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install git

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y
```

**Step 2: Install Node.js**

```bash
# Windows
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS

# macOS
brew install node

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

**Step 3: Clone and Setup**

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/21104988d/project1
cd project1

# Run automated setup script
./scripts/setup-review.sh       # Mac/Linux
# OR
scripts\setup-review.bat        # Windows
```

### üöÄ Start the Application

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd the-project

# Install dependencies (if not already done by setup script)
npm install

# Start the application (works in Codespaces and local):
npm run dev

# The app will be available at:
# - http://localhost:5173 (local)
# - Auto-forwarded port (in Codespaces)
```

## üÜò Need Help?

### üîß Starting From Scratch (Only VS Code Installed)

**If you only have VS Code and nothing else:**

1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Open Terminal** (Press `Ctrl+`` or View ‚Üí Terminal)
3. **Run the complete setup:**

```bash
# One command installs everything (Git, Node.js, clones repo, sets up app)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/21104988d/project1/main/scripts/complete-setup.sh | bash
```

**For Windows users:**

```cmd
# Download and run the Windows setup script
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/21104988d/project1/main/scripts/complete-setup.bat' -OutFile 'setup.bat'; .\setup.bat"
```

### üöÄ Quick Fixes (If You Already Have Git/Node.js)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory first
cd the-project

# Method 1: Use the main dev script (recommended)
npm run dev

# Method 2: If dependencies are missing
npm install
npm run dev

# Alternative: Build and preview (frontend only)
npm run build -w @theproject/frontend
npm run preview -w @theproject/frontend
```

### üåê Codespaces-Specific Instructions

1. **Navigate to the correct directory**: Always start from `the-project`
2. **Use the forwarded port**: Click "Open in Browser" when the popup appears
3. **If you see a white screen**:
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+R)
   - Try the npx vite command above
   - Check the terminal for any error messages

### üîß Repository Structure Issues

If the one-click setup fails:

```bash
# 1. Check your current location
pwd
ls -la

# 2. Navigate directly to project
cd the-project

# 3. Install and start
npm install
npm run dev

# 4. If the-project doesn't exist, re-clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/21104988d/project1
cd project1
```

### üöÄ **Recommended Solution: GitHub Codespaces**

If you encounter repository structure issues, the easiest solution is to use GitHub Codespaces:

1. **Go to Repository**: https://github.com/21104988d/project1
2. **Create Codespace**: Click "Code" ‚Üí "Codespaces" ‚Üí "Create codespace"
3. **Wait for Setup**: Codespaces will automatically set up the complete environment
4. **Start App**: Run `cd the-project && npm install && npm run dev`

‚úÖ **Benefits**:

- No local software installation required
- Automatically resolves all repository structure issues
- Pre-configured development environment
- Instant access to demo environment
