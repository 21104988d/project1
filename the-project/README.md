### Package Overview

- **`packages/frontend/`**: React-based user interface with wallet integration
- **`packages/contracts/`**: Solidity smart contracts for cross-chain execution
- **`packages/routing-engine/`**: Core pathfinding and optimization algorithms
- **`packages/shared/`**: Common types, utilities, and constants
- **`packages/api/`**: REST API and WebSocket services

## üí° How It Works

### User Flow Example: ETH ‚Üí SOL

1. **User Input**: Select ETH on Ethereum and SOL on Solana
2. **Route Discovery**: Engine finds optimal path (ETH ‚Üí USDC ‚Üí Bridge ‚Üí SOL)
3. **Quote Generation**: Calculate exact output and total fees
4. **One-Click Execution**: User signs single transaction
5. **Automated Execution**: System handles all intermediate steps
6. **Asset Delivery**: SOL arrives in user's Solana wallet
